##General Information
***
This research is the product of an independent study in the Fall 2022 for Professor Deen Freelon that resulted in a 25-page paper. The purpose of this project is to investigate whether there are disparities in the association of Black people with crime that could be derived from who is featured on law enforcement Twitter accounts. This study investigates eight diverse police department and sheriff offices across the state of North Carolina to measure the racial demographics of who is featured on their Twitter feeds. Overwhelmingly Black people were disproportionally represented among the people who were featured in the Twitter feeds studied.
